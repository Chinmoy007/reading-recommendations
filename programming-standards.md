# Programming Standards

A place to write down my own version of the best programming standards, to update from time to time, 
to give to new developers as a starting point

# Being Professional
Robert Martin in `The Clean Coder` describes beautifully, that a professional developer should carry
a professional manners towards work. The book is awesome. 

My personal summary:
- keep yourself up to date, read books and high quality web articles
- discuss new trends and technologies with senior developers and architects
- make time every week to test new technologies, write small programs outside of client's needs to try new things
- be realistic and honest, say YES and NO, overtime usually doesnt help!
- take care of your mind, learn how to meditate, 
  - do the [Happiness Program](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/happiness-program) somewhere in your area to learn take care of your mind and energy
  - have **MUCH MORE ENERGY, CLARITY** and **FOCUS better** by regularly practising the Sudarshan Kriya

# Technical Standards
## php
Specific to php:
* use devilbox to have a ready environment using docker-compose 
* use the most recent stable version possible, and keep regularly migrating to benefit from latest versions
* use PhpStorm, 
  - install php code sniffer and php mess detectors
  - set PSR-12 coding style, adhere to PSR standards
* use composer
* use phpunit and codeception
* use Laravel
* use Swagger to document your API automatically

## git
Basically never work without it. Whenever starting even some small local thing, ``git int`` and you
can benefit from it.
